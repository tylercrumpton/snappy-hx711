Usage
-----

To use the ``snappy-hx711`` library functions, first import the
library and call `hx711_begin()` with the pin numbers connected to the
HX711. Then you can start taking measurements:

.. code:: python

    from snappy_hx711 import *

    CLOCK_PIN = 6
    DATA_PIN = 7

    @setHook(HOOK_INIT)
    def init():
        # Must be called before making measurements:
        hx711_begin(CLOCK_PIN, DATA_PIN)

    def take_a_measurement():
        # Returns a 3-byte string:
        return hx711_read()
